            In an attempt to rid the countryside of wolves, the US used a lethal program of ecessive bounties, poisons and government funded exterminators on any and all creatures that looked like wolves. By the early 1960s wolves of all kinds were all but eradicated from the nation; including that of a lesser known canine, the red wolf. In an interesting twist of fate, despite what is now continued pressure on the smaller species, the coyote instead has expanded its range across the US from its original desert and plains territories. It has even made its home in urban cities. It's prevalence and tenacity has ensured that it is here to stay. Meanwhile the genetic future and consequently, the conservation efforts for the red wolf remains in jeopardy.

            Now a petition is heading to Congress to list the red wolf as effectively extinct in the wild, a move that would remove all efforts to protect their precarious population and reverse efforts to save the species that began in 1987.

            Below is more information on the subject. Red wolf, hybrid or a new species? Should we save it and why? Also what exactly is a red wolf anyway, and how does it differ from typical wolves? What's with this coyote thing and why is it dangerous to the red wolf?<!--Summary of the purpose of the document-->

                <h2>Red Wolves</h2>
                <p>
                    Red wolves are a medium-large dog-like canine that is considered to have ranged from the middle of the US all the way to the eastern coast and down into Florida. Now with only 200 individuals in captive breeding programs and only 100 individuals in the wild, the red wolf's range is now largely confined to a small section of the state of North Carolina. State and federal run programs have gained the species some ground, but with seemingly little gain.
                    <!--info about red wolves here-->
                </p>
                <h3>Appearence</h3>
                <p>The red wolf is primarily known for it's reddish fur. Though dark brown and black are the coat's dominant color, the red parts include the legs and sometimes face, back of ears and sides of the tail. Its ears are larger and more pointed than the gray wolf and it lacks the wide range of color, coat length and subspecies variations that the larger species has. It appears taller and lankier than it would otherwise seem and the tail hangs lower, but it is still stockier in build than the smaller coyote.</p>
                <h3>Genetics</h3>
                <p>The federal government started its breeding programs with a small remnant population of just fourteen individuals taken from the wild. Concerns over inbreeding depression affecting the health and viability of future genereations set the species back. Although there was no evidence of it happening. At the time the program was instituted, wildlife scientists lacked the genetic testing equipment of today and the determination of what was a red wolf was made mostly on appearence alone. Due to recent evidence of widespread coyote DNA in the red wolf population opponents of protection have wondered if it is even worth saving at all.</p>
                <h3>Hybridization</h3>
                <p>
                    Where wolves, coyotes, dogs and red wolves are able to breed freely, remnant populations, desperate to breed and unable to find mates, have on occassion, mated with another species. The red wolf, with its dangerously low numbers began breeding with the coyote population as it made its way into territories that wolves as a whole no longer occupied. To ensure the success of the species survial program, an aggressive stance on coyotes and coyote/red wolf hybrids was instituted with extermination as its goal. The problem with extermination and coyotes is simply it has not worked. Ever. New coyotes always occupy the open spaces left after resident coyotes are removed. This means that the problem of widespread hybridization was never fully prevented. Only in recent years have attempts been made to sterilize coyote and hybrid populations to prevent hybridization. However, it has already occured and removing the coyote genes may not actually be a possibility, even over the course of many generations.
                </p>
                <h3>New Species or Why the Red Wolf must be saved</h3>

                <p>
                    <!--somewhere in here mention the fact that evolution is also geographically influenced, reference the Grand Canyon squirrels-->
                    <!--Also point out the need for predators, relate deer/car accident deaths, deer control programs that dont work, the compretions between larger predators and coyotes begin the ONLY effective solution to coyote control, and the possibility that a Sustainable hunt could be institiuted in the future when the species took hold, ala the american alligator hunts in florida.-->
                    Although one could argue that the hybridization of the red wolf has driven it to extinction. However, there is another possibility. Another species suffered a similar fate, yet unlike the wolf, this was intentional.
                <p>The Florida panther, the last 50 individuals of its kind was threatened with extinction due to the lack of suitable mates, low birth rates and genetic defects that became exposed due to the lack of genetic diversity in the population.  Similarly related cougars from Texas were introduced to help stabilize the genetic makeup of the population. Although one could claim that it meant the death of the panther, it at least ensured the animal's survival and the preservation of whatever genes it had that made it a unique subspecies in the first place. Now the population rests as 160 individuals in the wild, with habitat loss and a lack of suitable natural corridors to allow the panther to expand its territory into historical areas.</p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps instead of regardingin the red wolf as a lost cause to hyrbid ization, it instead should be viewed as a "new" species. Although humans had a hand in its arrival, they also had a hand in its earlier destruction.

                <h2>Gray Wolves</h2>
                <p>
                    Comprising several subspecies, gray wolves exist in almost every habitat above the equator. No other mammal is more widespread than the wolf except for the human species. However, no other mammal has suffered as much blatant extermination efforts.
                    <!--info about gray wolves here-->
                </p>
                <h3>Appearence</h3>
                <p>Ranging from all shades of color from white to pitch black, categorising the large canine has been relatively difficult. Although there are many more subspecies listed, most expects currently recognize five of them as existing in the US and Canada. The Alaskan Wolf (Canis lupus Occidentalis) extends from Alaska well into western Canada. It is the largest of the subspecies.  The Arctic Wolf (Canis lupus arctos) is found mainly in the arctic islands in Canada. It is characterized by its white fur that is often shaded with small patches of black in the shoulders and top of the back. It is a smaller wolf with shorter ears and a stockier build to help conserve warmth. The Great Plains Wolf (Canis lupus nubilus) was originally thought to be extinct, though studies confirmed that the wolves in Minnesota and Wisconsin are of this subspecies. They are medium size, tending to be around 100 pounds and usually lighter colored although black furred individuals exist in the group. The Eastern Wolf (Canis lupus lycaon) of which the Timber wolf is lumped into is a somewhat smaller subspecies with longer tipped ears and a slender build. The Mexican Wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) is the smallest of the North American subspecies, but is also the one with the most richly colored coat. </p>
                <h3>There's Endangered and then there's ENDANGERED!</h3>
                <p>While all wolves in North America (with the exception of those in Canada) are endangered, no subspecies is in more danger of disappearing than the Mexican wolf. Originally exterminated from the wild, four males and one pregnant female were brought into captivity to save it from extinction. Now the population has rebounded through careful maintence and protection, to 109 individuals in the wild and another 200 in captivity. While a great success, the subspecies is far from reclaiming its ancestral territories in the southwestern US and Mexico.</p>
                <h3>The Algonquin Wolf, The Timber Wolf, the Eastern Wolf, the Red Wolf and Coyotes</h3>
                <p>Recent studies have suggested that the Eastern wolf is actually more related to the red wolf than originally thought. While the subspecies is still classed and treated as a gray wolf, this controversy lingers over the future of the red wolf species. Classification of the red wolf as an Eastern wolf and vice versa may affect the species recovery efforts. These wolves come in all varieties of colors, although there is a variety in the Algonquin region of Canada that shares a similar reddish coloration to the red wolf. These wolves, and the group once known as Timber wolves in the north eastern area of the US also share the same problem of some individuals having hybridized at some point with coyotes. However, hybridization has seemed rare at best. </p>
                <p><!--hybridization concerns, include references to the Timber wolf of Eastern US and Algonquin variety wolf as having coyote genes. Include a minor footnote about the Mexican wolf recovery effort and links to other sites for more information--></p>

                <h2>Coyotes</h2>
                <p>
                    The maligned coyote. Although the plentiful species does not have as many allies, none can claim that it isn't resilient. Basically coyotes exist anywhere wolves are not. Originally confined to arid desert regions, or at least, more commonly found in desert regions, coyote populations were far below what they are today. As man built cities and drove wolves out of the lower fourty eight, the coyote moved right in. Without the competition from the larger species, the coyote easily filled the niche left behind. However, unlike wolves, coyotes do not possess the same fear of humans to the extent that wolves do and even live in urban areas and cities. <!--info about coyotes here-->
                </p>
                <h3>Appearence</h3>
                <p>Coyotes are smaller than wolves, usually no larger than 40 pounds. They are often a yellowish tan color with flecks of black and brown in their fur. They can also come in white and black, though these colors are rare, and there are even reddish coyotes. Coyotes in desert regions tend to have shorter fur than coyotes in more northern regions. In areas where coyote populations overlap with remaining wolf populations there is evidence that there have been hybrids produced, though rare. Coyotes in the north eastern part of the United States are larger and have even taken to pack hunting deer, instead of their usual smaller fare. </p>
