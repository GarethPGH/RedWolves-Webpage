My original goal was to produce a MVC page that would have 1 admin only account (most likely an admin, and guest functionality) and three sample data objects about three species of wild canines in the United States. These data objects would be pulled into the front page view when triggered by the pagination tabs. Sample paragraphs were taken from Wikipedia. Expanded data objects would have photos for comparison, more in depth structured articles, links to more information and fancier styling. 

The project was fraught with many setbacks, mainly from the website ignoring my JS file that is supposed to bridge the nav bar with my pages. Most probably because of my misunderstanding of the use cases for MVC, how exactly an MVC web application is supposed to work, and my elementery understanding of Javascript. I tried and failed to use Angular to tie it together. That version of the project was scrapped.
